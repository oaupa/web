				<h2>We are a Congregation of Faith, Family and Friends.</h2>
				<p>Our History: In December 2006, God commissioned Pastor Lola Oyeye, her husband Sylvester Oyeye and  founded Mountain of Prayer and Praise International Ministries (MOPP) in Houston, Texas. 
				   They are devoted parents with two children Samuel and Esther. After her seminary training, she was ordained as a Pastor in May 2006. 
				   she is a teacher of uncompromised scriptures of the Holy Bible, she dynamically operates in the prophetic and evangelistic ministries to win back the lost souls and to specifically cater to the children of God who have been
				   overburdened by the problems of this world. </p>
				<p><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i>Pastor Lola is charged to minister to those rejected, dejected, oppressed, depressed, disappointed, divorced, and in different types of bondages. 
					If you are reading this, perhaps God wants to get your attention. He might be calling you to open up your mind and heart to receive and welcome His increasing presence in your life. God wants your life to be transformed from your present crossroad.
					 You may wonder what crossroad? any person at some point in their lives comes to a crossroad where things are so uncomfortable and unacceptable.</p>
				<p><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i>You may be at that crossroad now. It could be a crossroad of failure, disappointment, sickness, barrenness, joblessness, immigration challenges, inner void, 
					relationship challenges, marital crisis, financial challenges, etc. 
					Whatever your crossroad may be, God is using Pastor Lola right now to reach out to you and bring you into Godâ€™s family.
					God is the only true answer to a victorious and transformed life.  You can call Pastor Lola right now for prayers, and come worship with us this week, we are a church of faith, family and friends,
					 our meetings consist of prayer, praising God and studying of the scriptures of the Holy Bible, 
					during our fellowship the glory of God can  transform your life into a higher ground. </p>
